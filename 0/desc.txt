generate 3 input files:

python gen.py 10000 > in_10k.txt
python gen.py 100000 > in_100k.txt
python gen.py 1000000 > in_1m.txt


then use these input as an inputs for the task1 and task2
Try to solve task1 and task2 in different ways (e.g with set, vector), and measure your solution running time with chrono.
